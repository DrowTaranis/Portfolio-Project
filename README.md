#README for Portfolio Project

The project assignment was for a static website to function as a portfolio site with various pages and at least one piece of JavaScript.

I created my site using the Ada Lovelace example as a loose template, with some changes here and there including two changeable picture galleries on separate pages.

The site also featured responsive design.

'Position: relative' came to the rescue more than once where margin and padding settings produced unexpected results.

I was pleased with the scaling of the images and the change of nav format at smaller screen sizes, and hope it makes for a smooth user experience.

The software that I used to write the site was a mix of Visual Studio Code, some version control with Git, Live Server and the console for checking functionality and scaling, and where needed for convenience for quickly stashing copy and paste phrases, even Notepad. The main chunks of writing went through a separate spellchecker too. The photographs are all mine and subject to my copyright.

It was created for the Codecademy full-stack coding course as part of a wider IT Career Switch course.

Feel free to look around and get in touch with any feedback.
